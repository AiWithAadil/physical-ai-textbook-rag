# Physical AI — Building Intelligent Systems That Interact with the Real World Constitution

## Project Vision and Purpose
The vision of "Physical AI — Building Intelligent Systems That Interact with the Real World" is to create an AI-driven educational textbook system that empowers beginner to intermediate developers to understand and build intelligent systems interacting with the physical world. Its purpose is to provide clear, structured, and interactive learning content.

## Target Audience
This system is designed for beginner to intermediate developers who seek to learn about AI, robotics, and cyber-physical systems. The content assumes a foundational understanding of programming concepts.

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First
All development—from content generation to system features—MUST begin with a clear, unambiguous, and comprehensive specification. This ensures alignment with the project vision and facilitates AI-assisted development.

### II. Modular Design
The system, including its content and codebase, MUST adhere to a modular design philosophy. Components, chapters, and code units MUST be self-contained, independently testable, and have clearly defined interfaces.

### III. AI-Assisted Development
Leverage AI agents and MCP-enabled tooling for all stages of development, including content generation, code implementation, testing, and documentation. This principle aims to enhance efficiency, consistency, and innovation.

## System Boundaries

### In Scope
- AI-driven content generation for educational textbooks.
- Structured chapters, explanations, and practical examples.
- Tools and frameworks for conceptual understanding and simulation of physical AI systems.

### Out of Scope
- Direct control or interaction with real-world hardware.
- Development of production-ready physical AI systems.
- Advanced research in AI theory (focus is on practical application).

## High-Level Architecture
The system architecture will comprise a layered approach:
- **Specifications Layer**: Defines content structure, learning objectives, and system behavior.
- **AI Agents Layer**: Generates, reviews, and refines content based on specifications.
- **MCP-Enabled Tooling Layer**: Provides a robust, extensible environment for development and content creation.
- **Documentation Layer**: Ensures all aspects of the system and its content are well-documented and accessible.

## Expected Outputs
- Highly structured and comprehensive educational chapters.
- Clear, concise explanations of complex Physical AI concepts.
- Practical, runnable code examples and simulations.
- Interactive learning exercises and assessments.

## Governance
This Constitution serves as the single source of truth for all future specifications, agents, and content generation. All amendments to this Constitution MUST be documented, approved by stakeholders, and include a clear migration plan for affected artifacts. All development and content creation MUST verify compliance with these principles.
