# Glossary

## A

**Actuator**: A device that converts electrical or hydraulic signals into physical motion or force. Examples: motors, servos, pneumatic cylinders.

**Autonomous**: Operating independently without human intervention, though typically with human-defined objectives.

## C

**Cyber-Physical System (CPS)**: An integrated system combining computation, communication, and control of physical processes. Often used interchangeably with Physical AI.

**Control Loop**: The continuous cycle of sensing, decision-making, and actuation that allows a system to achieve and maintain a desired state.

## D

**Deep Learning**: Machine learning approach using neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations from data.

**Domain Randomization**: Training in diverse, randomized simulations to improve robustness to real-world variations.

## E

**Edge AI**: Running AI algorithms on edge devices (robots, sensors) rather than centralized servers.

**Encoder**: A sensor that measures joint rotation or linear motion, providing position and velocity feedback.

## F

**Force Closure**: A grasp configuration where the gripper can resist forces and torques from any direction.

**Forward Kinematics**: Computing end-effector position and orientation from joint angles.

## G

**Grasp Planning**: The process of determining where and how a gripper should contact an object for stable manipulation.

**GPS (Global Positioning System)**: Satellite-based system for determining geographic location outdoors.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: Sensor measuring acceleration and rotational velocity.

**Inverse Kinematics**: Computing joint angles required to reach a desired end-effector position and orientation.

## L

**LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: Sensor that uses laser to create 3D maps of environments.

**Localization**: Determining the position and orientation of a system in its environment.

## M

**Manipulation**: Interaction with objects through grasping, pushing, or other forms of contact.

**Mapping**: Creating a representation of an environment, typically used in localization and path planning.

## O

**Odometry**: Estimating position changes through wheel rotations and inertial measurements.

**Occupancy Grid**: A discretized spatial representation where each cell is classified as free or occupied space.

## P

**Path Planning**: Computing a sequence of movements to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles.

**PID Controller**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller; the most common feedback control mechanism.

**Physical AI**: Intelligent systems that perceive and act on physical environments through sensors and actuators.

## R

**Reinforcement Learning**: Learning approach where agents learn optimal behaviors through reward signals from environment interaction.

**RGBD Camera**: Camera providing both color (RGB) and depth (D) information.

## S

**Sensor Fusion**: Combining information from multiple sensors to improve accuracy and robustness.

**Servo Motor**: Electric motor with closed-loop position control, commonly used in robotics.

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Technique to build a map while determining position within it.

## T

**Transfer Learning**: Leveraging knowledge from one task to improve learning on a related task.

## V

**Vision**: Perception through cameras or other visual sensors.
