# Physical AI: Building Intelligent Systems That Interact with the Real World

Welcome to this comprehensive textbook on Physical AI (Cyber-Physical Systems and Robotics). This book is designed for beginner-to-intermediate developers who want to understand how AI systems perceive, decide, and act in physical environments.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers the complete spectrum of Physical AI, from foundational concepts to advanced integration techniques:

### **Part 1: Foundations** (Chapters 1–4)
- Understanding what Physical AI is and its applications
- How systems perceive the world through sensors
- Making intelligent decisions with AI logic and control
- Taking action through actuators and motor control

### **Part 2: Practical Systems** (Chapters 5–8)
- Building autonomous mobile robots
- Robot manipulation and grasping strategies
- Advanced computer vision techniques
- Coordinating multiple sensors and agents

### **Part 3: Advanced Topics** (Chapters 9–12)
- Learning and adaptation in physical systems
- Safety, robustness, and reliability concerns
- Bridging simulation and real-world deployment
- Integrating everything with real-world case studies

## How to Use This Book
