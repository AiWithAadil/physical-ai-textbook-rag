# Chapter 4: Actuation — Making Systems Act

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand different types of actuators
2. Learn motor control principles
3. Execute decisions through physical systems
4. Simulate actuator behavior

## Introduction

Perception and decision-making are meaningless without action. Actuators convert digital commands into physical motion and force.

## Actuator Types

### Electric Motors
- **DC Motors**: Simple, brushless variants for precision
- **Servo Motors**: Precise position control
- **Stepper Motors**: Discrete position steps
- **Brushless DC**: High efficiency, low maintenance

### Hydraulics and Pneumatics
- **Hydraulic Systems**: High force, smooth motion
- **Pneumatic Systems**: Safe, simple actuation

### Specialized Actuators
- **Linear Actuators**: Push-pull motion
- **Valves**: Flow and pressure control
- **End Effectors**: Grippers, suction cups

## Motor Control Principles

### Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
Control speed and direction through duty cycle variation

### Torque and Speed Control
Trade-offs between force and velocity

### Safety Limits
- Maximum speed and acceleration
- Current limits to prevent damage
- Position constraints

## Simulation of Physical Effects

Use simulation frameworks (PyBullet, Gazebo) to:
- Test actuator behavior before hardware
- Validate control algorithms
- Explore edge cases safely

## Key Takeaways

- Multiple actuation technologies exist for different applications
- Motor control is well-understood, mature technology
- Simulation validates designs before deployment

## Review Questions

1. What are common types of electric motors?
2. How does PWM control motor speed?
3. What are safety limits and why are they important?
