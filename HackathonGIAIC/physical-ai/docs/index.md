# Physical AI

## Building Intelligent Systems That Interact with the Real World

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI. This book is designed for beginner-to-intermediate developers who want to understand how AI systems perceive, decide, and act in physical environments.

### What You'll Learn

Dive into the complete spectrum of Physical AI, from foundational concepts to advanced integration techniques:

**Part 1: Foundations** — Understand the basics of Physical AI, how systems perceive their environment, make intelligent decisions, and take action through actuators.

**Part 2: Practical Systems** — Build real-world applications including autonomous mobile robots, robotic manipulation, computer vision, and distributed sensor networks.

**Part 3: Advanced Topics** — Master learning in physical systems, safety and reliability, real-world deployment challenges, and explore future directions through integrated case studies.
